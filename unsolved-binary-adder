Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

def add_binary(a,b):
    #your code here
    
change the last "0" to a "1" to add one
If every digit is a "1" Add a "1" to the front of the number, and "reset" all the other digits to 0

0 = 0    
1 = 1
2 = 10
3 = 11
4 = 100
5 = 110 
6 = 111
7 =
8 =
9 =
10 =

binary = "0"
if (binary[len(binary)-1:]) == "0":
    binary = (binary[:len(binary)-1]) + ("1")
